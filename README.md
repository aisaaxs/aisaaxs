# Hello World,

My name’s Anitej Isaac Sharma, but since we’re friends now, just call me Ani. I’m your friendly neighbourhood developer who loves breaking things just to fix them better, learning tech I’ll probably never use again, and occasionally building stuff for fun (or out of existential necessity).

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UBC, because apparently, watching code break in the Vancouver rain builds character. Just kidding, I actually attended the Okanagan campus, where everything's better with a glass of wine on the side. Well, kidding again cause I don’t really drink alcohol. I just say that because it sounds way cooler than “I survived CS with coffee and sheer panic.”

Anyways, I’m currently a Software Support Specialist at Tyler Technologies. And no, I’m not cracking any jokes about it just yet, because I’m still under probation. Gotta keep my reputation squeaky clean while I figure out how to pretend I know what I’m doing.

As for why I’m on GitHub?

Well, besides trying to fit the classic computer science stereotype (just kidding, we actually need this to show we do some work), I trust my computer about as much as I trust random npm packages. So naturally, I offload my code (and my backups) to a massive corporation and pretend this is what “version control” really means.

Anyway, welcome to the chaos. Grab a coffee, browse the repos, and please, don’t judge the commit messages! :)

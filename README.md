## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **Anitej Isaac Sharma**, a recent B.Sc. Computer Science graduate from [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), class of 2025.

Over the last four years at UBC, I built a strong foundation in computer science, data analytics, and software engineeringâ€”while also broadening my perspective with courses in management, mathematics, languages, and the humanities.

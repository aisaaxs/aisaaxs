## Hi there! üëã

I‚Äôm **Anitej Isaac Sharma**, a recent B.Sc. Computer Science graduate from [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), class of 2025.

Over the last four years at UBC, I built a strong foundation in computer science, data analytics, and software engineering‚Äîwhile also broadening my perspective with courses in management, mathematics, languages, and the humanities.

After graduating, I dedicated 2.5 months to job hunting and participated in numerous interviews. My perseverance paid off when I landed a role as a **Software Support Specialist** with Tyler Technologies in July 2025.
